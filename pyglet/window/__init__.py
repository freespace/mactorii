'''Windowing and user-interface events.

This module allows applications to create and display windows with an
OpenGL context.  Windows can be created with a variety of border styles 
or set fullscreen.

You can register event handlers for keyboard, mouse and window events.
For games and kiosks you can also restrict the input to your windows,
for example disabling users from switching away from the application
with certain key combinations or capturing and hiding the mouse.

Getting started
---------------

Call the Window constructor to create a new window::

    from pyglet.window import Window
    win = Window(width=640, height=480)

Attach your own event handlers::

    @win.event
    def on_key_press(symbol, modifiers):
        # ... handle this event ...

Within your main run loop, you must call `Window.dispatch_events` regularly.
Windows are double-buffered by default, so you must call `Window.flip` to
update the display::

    while not win.has_exit:
        win.dispatch_events()
        # ... drawing commands ...
        win.flip()

Creating a game window
----------------------

Use `Window.set_exclusive_mouse` to hide the mouse cursor and receive relative
mouse movement events.  Specify ``fullscreen=True`` as a keyword argument to
the `Window` constructor to render to the entire screen rather than opening a
window::

    win = Window(fullscreen=True)
    win.set_exclusive_mouse()

Working with multiple windows
-----------------------------

You can open any number of windows and render to them individually.  Each
window must have the event handlers set on it that you are interested in
(i.e., each window will have its own mouse event handler).  

You must call `Window.dispatch_events` for each window.  Before rendering
to a window, you must call `Window.switch_to` to set the active GL context.
Here is an example run loop for a list of windows::

    windows = # list of Window instances
    while windows:
        for win in windows:
            win.dispatch_events()
            if win.has_exit:
                win.close()
        windows = [w for w in windows if not w.has_exit]
   
        for win in windows:
            win.switch_to()
            # ... drawing commands for this window ...
            win.flip()

Working with multiple screens
-----------------------------

By default, fullscreen windows are opened on the primary display (typically
set by the user in their operating system settings).  You can retrieve a list
of attached screens and select one manually if you prefer.  This is useful for
opening a fullscreen window on each screen::

    display = window.get_platform().get_default_display()
    screens = display.get_screens()
    windows = []
    for screen in screens:
        windows.append(window.Window(fullscreen=True, screen=screen))

Specifying a screen has no effect if the window is not fullscreen.

Specifying the OpenGL context properties
----------------------------------------

Each window has its own context which is created when the window is created.
You can specify the properties of the context before it is created
by creating a "template" configuration::

    from pyglet import gl
    # Create template config
    config = gl.Config()
    config.stencil_size = 8
    config.aux_buffers = 4
    # Create a window using this config
    win = window.Window(config=config)

To determine if a given configuration is supported, query the screen (see
above, "Working with multiple screens")::

    configs = screen.get_matching_configs(config)
    if not configs:
        # ... config is not supported
    else:
        win = window.Window(config=configs[0])

    widgets or controls; all rendering must be done via OpenGL.

    screen (fullscreen).  When floating, windows may appear borderless or
    decorated with a platform-specific frame (including, for example, the
    title bar, minimize and close buttons, resize handles, and so on).

    While it is possible to set the location of a window, it is recommended
    that applications allow the platform to place it according to local
    conventions.  This will ensure it is not obscured by other windows,
    and appears on an appropriate screen for the user.

                One of the ``WINDOW_STYLE_*`` constants specifying the

                The screen to use, if in fullscreen.
            `config` : `pyglet.gl.Config`
                Either a template from which to create a complete config,
                or a complete config.
            `context` : `pyglet.gl.Context`

            You should always use this method for responding to text selection
