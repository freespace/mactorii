'''Audio and video playback.

pyglet can play WAV files, and if AVbin is installed, many other audio and
video formats.

Playback is handled by the `Player` class, which reads raw data from `Source`
objects and provides methods for pausing, seeking, adjusting the volume, and
so on.  The `Player` class implements a the best available audio device
(currently, only OpenAL is supported)::

    player = Player()

A `Source` is used to decode arbitrary audio and video files.  It is
associated with a single player by "queuing" it::

    source = load('background_music.mp3')
    player.queue(source)

Use the `Player` to control playback.  Within your main run loop, you must
periodically call `dispatch_events` to ensure the audio buffers are refilled::

    player.play()
    while player.source:    # While the source hasn't finished
        player.dispatch_events()

If the source contains video, the `Source.video_format` attribute will be
non-None, and the `Player.texture` attribute will contain the current video
image synchronised to the audio.

Decoding sounds can be processor-intensive and may introduce latency,
particularly for short sounds that must be played quickly, such as bullets or
explosions.  You can force such sounds to be decoded and retained in memory
rather than streamed from disk by wrapping the source in a `StaticSource`::

    bullet_sound = StaticSource(load('bullet.wav'))

The other advantage of a `StaticSource` is that it can be queued on any number
of players, and so played many times simultaneously.
