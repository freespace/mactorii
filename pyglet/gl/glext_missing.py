'''Additional hand-coded GL extensions.

These are hand-wrapped extension tokens and functions that are in
the OpenGL Extension Registry but have not yet been added to either 
the registry's glext.h or nVidia's glext.h.  Remove wraps from here
when the headers are updated (and glext_arb.py or glext_nv.py are
regenerated).

When adding an extension here, include the name and URL, and any tokens and
functions appearing under "New Tokens" and "New Procedures" headings.  Don't
forget to add the GL_/gl prefix.

Unnumbered extensions in the registry are not included.
