'''Event dispatch framework.

All objects that produce events in pyglet implement `EventDispatcher`,
providing a consistent interface for registering and manipulating event
handlers.  A commonly used event dispatcher is `pyglet.window.Window`.

Event types
===========

For each event dispatcher there is a set of events that it dispatches; these
correspond with the type of event handlers you can attach.  Event types are
identified by their name, for example, ''on_resize''.  If you are creating a
new class which implements `EventDispatcher`, you must call
`EventDispatcher.register_event_type` for each event type.

Attaching event handlers
========================

An event handler is simply a function or method.  You can attach an event
handler by setting the appropriate function on the instance::

    def on_resize(width, height):
        # ...
    dispatcher.on_resize = on_resize

There is also a convenience decorator that reduces typing::

    @dispatcher.event
    def on_resize(width, height):
        # ...

You may prefer to subclass and override the event handlers instead::

    class MyDispatcher(DispatcherClass):
        def on_resize(self, width, height):
            # ...

Event handler stack
===================

When attaching an event handler to a dispatcher using the above methods, it
replaces any existing handler (causing the original handler to no longer be
called).  Each dispatcher maintains a stack of event handlers, allowing you to
insert an event handler "above" the existing one rather than replacing it.

There are two main use cases for "pushing" event handlers:

* Temporarily intercepting the events coming from the dispatcher by pushing a
  custom set of handlers onto the dispatcher, then later "popping" them all
  off at once.
* Creating "chains" of event handlers, where the event propogates from the
  top-most (most recently added) handler to the bottom, until a handler
  takes care of it.

Use `EventDispatcher.push_handlers` to create a new level in the stack and
attach handlers to it.  You can push several handlers at once::

    dispatcher.push_handlers(on_resize, on_key_press)

If your function handlers have different names to the events they handle, use
keyword arguments::

    dispatcher.push_handlers(on_resize=my_resize,
                             on_key_press=my_key_press)

After an event handler has processed an event, it is passed on to the
next-lowest event handler, unless the handler returns `EVENT_HANDLED`, which
prevents further propogation.

To remove all handlers on the top stack level, use
`EventDispatcher.pop_handlers`.

Note that any handlers pushed onto the stack have precedence over the
handlers set directly on the instance (for example, using the methods
described in the previous section), regardless of when they were set.
For example, handler ``foo`` is called before handler ``bar`` in the following
example::

    dispatcher.push_handlers(on_resize=foo)
    dispatcher.on_resize = bar

Dispatching events
==================

pyglet uses a single-threaded model for all application code.  Event
handlers are only ever invoked as a result of calling
EventDispatcher.dispatch_events`.

It is up to the specific event dispatcher to queue relevant events until they
can be dispatched, at which point the handlers are called in the order the
events were originally generated.

This implies that your application runs with a main loop that continously
updates the application state and checks for new events::

    while True:
        dispatcher.dispatch_events()
        # ... additional per-frame processing

Not all event dispatchers require the call to ``dispatch_events``; check with
the particular class documentation.
